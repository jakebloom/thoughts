There are so many places to track covid data, and they all seem to present different information. You can find a graph of daily new infections, graphs of hospital beds used, cumulative infections over time, positivity rates, the ratio of ICU beds vs regular beds used divided by population density over a log scale... the list goes on.

I wanted one place where I could get a sense of how we are doing, and I wanted to be able to see it for my local area.

The metric I chose was average new infections over 7 days, because this gives a really clear indication as to whether infections are increasing or decreasing without the noise that daily new case graphs give you.

The area I chose was San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.

The graphs are updated twice per day.
