And thus ends the tenure of Darryl Gibson, coach of the NSW Waratahs from 2016 to 2019. In that time, the Tahs finished 10th (out of 18), 16th (out of 18), 3rd (out of 15) and 12th (out of 15). With two finishes dangerously close to the spoon and three out of four finishes in the bottom half of the table, it was clear that something had to give.

Contrast this with Michael Chieka’s era in charge of the Tahs - 9th (out of 15), 1st and a title and 2nd with a semi-final loss to the eventual champions.

Coaching the Tahs is hard. There has got to be a structural reason why the focal point of rugby in Australia has only managed one title in 23 years. Is it the pressure to perform? Is Sydney too exciting a place to live to want to train? Does the fickle sporting public not invest enough in the team to see it succeed?

The reality is that it has been a confluence of factors throughout the history of the professional game. From the start of the professional era until the mid-2000s, NSW Rugby was slow to adapt, systems like “NSW A”, schools and age group championships didn’t come in until later, and the focus remained beating Queensland and touring national sides.

Once reality set in and the proper systems were set up, the team became pretty good, with finals appearances in 2005 and 2008, semi final appearances in 2003 (hat tip to Matt Dunning) and 2010. What was missing there seems to be the 1% that Michael Chieka brought in. From running up Coogee stairs, he built a team that would conquer all.

I don’t believe that the 1%, or that hardened edge is gone today. So what is missing from this Waratahs team? Johnson-Holmes and Robinson are quality props. Fitzpatrick is a good hooker, and Michael Hooper is an exceptional player. Jake Gordon is the kind of person that you could see captaining the side one day, and if players coming through the under 20s like Will Harrison and Ben Donaldson are managed properly, there are serious green shoots coming through.

What the Waratahs really need are some giant forwards. The lock spots are well up for grabs, and we need someone in the mould of Jacques Pottgieter to come in and bring an edge to the forward pack. 

How does this translate to the Wallabies? Well. If the team can fire, it looks very very good. A pack that includes the set piece dominance of the Brumbies with the backline nous of the Rebels and the Tahs bodes well.

Just as you can’t count out the Aussie cricket team in the world cup, so too can you not count out the Wallabies in Japan.
